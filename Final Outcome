## Final Outcome

Final Outcome of the Project
The gender prediction model using dental metrics was successfully developed and evaluated. After training multiple machine learning models, the Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 91%, making it the best-performing model for classifying gender based on dental measurements.

Key Findings:
âœ… Dental features are strong predictors of gender, with intercanine distance, canine width, and other measurements contributing significantly to classification.
âœ… Random Forest outperformed other models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and XGBoost, in terms of accuracy and reliability.
âœ… The model can aid forensic and dental studies, demonstrating the potential use of machine learning in gender determination from dental records.

This project validates the feasibility of using dental metrics for gender classification and opens avenues for further improvements using larger datasets and advanced techniques. ðŸš€
